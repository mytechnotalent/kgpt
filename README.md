# convergence, on the other hand, a lower learning rate may require more iterations for 
# convergence but can provide more precise parameter updates

# however, it also increases the computational cost and the number of parameters in the model

# the n_layer parameter specifies the number of transformer blocks or layers in the model and

# the dropout parameter represents the dropout probability, which determines the probability 
# of randomly setting inputs to zero during training and dropout is a regularization technique 
# that helps prevent overfitting by reducing co-adaptation between neurons and a dropout value 
# of 0.0 means no dropout is applied, while a value of 1.0 means all inputs are set to zero and 
# adjusting the dropout value can influence the model's generalization ability and higher dropout 
# values introduce more regularization, which can be useful when dealing with limited training
